      "Hydrophobins are small proteins with an amphipathic structure that were initially\n",
      "isolated from Schizophyllum commune [1]. This family of proteins is mainly composed of\n",
      "100–150 amino acids, which are frequently found in the mycelia of fungi. Hydrophobins\n",
      "provide a hydrophobic surface layer through self-assembly on the hydrophilic hypha of\n",
      "growing mycelium, when monomers are secreted on the surface of growing mycelia. As\n",
      "a result, hydrophobins serve to coat the surface of the hyphae due to the amphiphilic\n",
      "nature of the protein [2–4]. In addition, hydrophobins not only enable hyphae to effectively\n",
      "respond to environmental changes but also function as a shield between the cell wall and\n",
      "air layer or at the interface between the cell wall and a solid surface during sporulation,\n",
      "fruiting body development, and infection structure formation through host invasion [5].\n",
      "Hydrophobins typically have four disulﬁde bonds originating from eight cysteine\n",

      "hydrophilic–hydrophobic interface [9–13]. Due to the above features, hydrophobins have\n",
      "been spotlighted in the biomaterial industry [14]. Accordingly, utilizing hydrophobins in\n",
      "cosmetics or food and beverages requiring a stable and uniform foam has been well stud-\n",
      "ied [15]. In addition, hydrophobins have received increased attention in various industries\n",
      "as an innovative next-generation material, including use as a medical coating agent, and as\n",
      "a functional particle in nanostructures applied to the living body [15–17].\n",
      "Currently, various production methods, including a recombinant technique using\n",
      "bacteria, yeast, and plant cells as expression hosts, or a fermentation method using the\n",
      "original producer fungus have been attempted [18–22]. Although several reports described\n",
      "successfully soluble expression in Pichia pastoris, recombinant hydrophobins produced in\n",
      "bacteria, especially E. coli, as inclusion bodies need to be preprocessed for further utilization.\n",
      "In this case, a denaturation/refolding process is required to obtain a functional protein,\n",
      "which results in increased cost and time for the mass production of hydrophobins. For\n",
      "example, it was reported by BASF SE in 2009 that two recombinant class I hydrophobins,\n",
      "H*Protein A (yaaD-DewA-His6), and H*Protein B (truncated yaaD-DewA-His6), can be\n",
      "produced in adequate amounts for industrial application, using bacteria as a host. Un-\n",
      "fortunately, in this case, hydrophobins were also produced in an inclusion body form.\n",
      "Until now, there have been no case reports in which recombinant hydrophobins have been\n",

      "HPLC or a two-phase separation method (e.g., ATPS; aqueous two-phase separation) using\n",
      "a surfactant have mainly been used for purifying hydrophobins. However, this takes a\n",
      "long time and requires additional cost due to complex puriﬁcation procedures and use\n",
      "of chemicals that are not easy to handle [24,25]. Therefore, these issues require urgent\n",

      "An aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) method has been proposed as an ideal purification technique \n",
      "for the separation and recovery of biomolecules because of the system’s high productivity, simplicity, \n",
      "short processing time, cost effectiveness, scalability and versatility [1,2]. Therefore, ATPS has been \n",
      "widely employed for the separation of biological materials such as cells, cell debris, proteins and \n",
      "nucleic acids [3]. This method could be used to overcome the problem faced by conventional \n",
      "purification methods because of its speed, low interfacial tension, easy scale-up, minimized protein \n",
      "denaturation, non-toxicity and mild conditions [4]. It should be noted that the most well-known form \n",
      "of the method is based on two polymers e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran or one polymer \n",
      "and salt (e.g., PEG/sodium citrate) which have some disadvantages such as low segregation, high cost of \n",
      "polymers (e.g., dextran) and the complication of polymer isolation from the purified biomolecules [5].  \n",
      "A novel ATPS method using a thermo-separating polymer and organic solvent overcomes this \n",
      "drawback of the traditional ATPS methods. This system makes it possible to create two phases and the \n",
      "polymer rich top phase and organic solvent bottom phase can be recycled [6]. Thus, the improved \n",
      "ATPS method can minimize the overall cost and the separation process of target proteins from phase \n",
      "solution will be simplified. Furthermore, recycling the solution components can minimize \n",
      "environmental pollution. Amylases represent one of the most important industrial enzymes and have a \n",

      "Soybean Proteins. Soybeans contain a broad range of\n",
      "proteins, which are classified in different terms (1). On the basis\n",
      "of their solubility they are classified as globulins or albumins.\n",
      "Glycinin is the most abundant protein found in soybeans. It\n",
      "represents ∼25-35% of total seed protein and accounts for\n",
      ">40% of the total soybean globulin. It is widely used in the\n",
      "food industry as a filling agent due to its favorable gelatinous\n",
      "properties in aqueous solutions (2), as well as for its emulsifying\n",
      "and foaming activities (3). Although it has been known and\n",
      "used for years in the food industry, to this date a fast, efficient,\n",
      "and inexpensive process for obtaining pure glycinin from soy\n",
      "meal has not yet been developed.\n",
      "Nowadays pure proteins appear in different forms, mostly\n",
      "depending on their application and current state of the art of\n",
      "their production. In general, spray-dried proteins, protein\n",
      "crystals, and liquid protein preparations are found. Dry products\n",
      "have the advantage of stability over a long period of time. When\n",
      "it comes to production of pure protein in dry form, in most\n",
      "cases crystallization is a key step (e.g., in the production of\n",
      "pure enzymes). With finely tuned process parameters, crystal-\n",
      "lization enables recovery of a protein in a solid form with high\n",
      "purity grade.\n",
      "Glycinin is a hexameric protein comprised of five subunits\n",
      "(4). Each subunit comprises an acidic (molecular mass ∼40 kDa)\n",
      "and a basic (molecular mass ∼20 kDa) polypeptide, linked by\n",
      "a single disulfide bridge (5). These polypeptides are highly\n",
      "heterogeneous (6). Different glycinin subunits and corresponding\n",
      "glycinin genes have been identified and reported by various\n",
      "authors (3). Furthermore, different soybean cultivars appear to\n",
      "differ in content of the polypeptides constituting glycinin\n",
      "molecules (4). Glycinin molecules from different origins were\n",
      "proved to have different properties with respect to amino acid\n",
      "composition, molecular weight, and isoelectric point (7). It was\n",

      "one of the most expensive drug classes on the market [2]. In \n",
      "the past, the focus was set on bringing innovative products \n",
      "fast to the market and less on developing cost-efficient \n",

      "A typical CFIR has a configuration consisting of helical \n",

      " ABSTRACT: In this work we describe the new concept of using fungal hydrophobins as efficient tags for\n",
      "purification of recombinant fusion proteins by aqueous two-phase separation. Hydrophobins are a group\n",
      "of small surface-active proteins produced by filamentous fungi. Some characteristics of hydrophobins are\n",
      "that they are relatively small (approximately 100 amino acids), they contain eight disulfide-forming Cys\n",
      "residues in a conserved pattern, and they self-assemble on interfaces. The aqueous two-phase systems\n",
      "studied were based on nonionic surfactants that phase-separate at certain temperatures. We show that the\n",
      "use of hydrophobins as tags has many advantages such as high selectivity and good yield and is technically\n",
      "very simple to perform. Fusion proteins with target proteins of different molecular size were compared to\n",
      "the corresponding free proteins using a set of different surfactants. This gave an understanding on which\n",
      "factors influence the separation and what rationale should be used for optimization. This unusually strong\n",
      "and specific interaction between polymeric surfactants and a soluble protein shows promise for new\n",
      "developments in interfacing proteins and nonbiological materials for other applications as well.\n",
      "For selective purification of proteins, affinity chromatog-\n",
      "raphy is one of the most efficient methods available. The\n",
      "selectivity of this method can be based on, for example,\n",
      "recognition of the target protein by specific antibodies or\n",
      "the use of various affinity tags fused to the target protein.\n",
      "Examples of such tags are, for instance, glutathione S-\n",
      "transferase or small peptides such as the His tag that\n",
      "selectively bind to purification columns (1, 2). If desired,\n",
      "the affinity tags can later be cleaved off from the target\n",
      "protein by specific proteases recognizing and cleaving at\n",
      "recognition sites that have been introduced to the fusion\n",
      "protein. Often affinity chromatography methods are only\n",
      "suited for analytical purposes and for purification of products\n",
      "of high value and are too expensive for large-scale products\n",
      "such as industrial enzymes. Furthermore, the methods are\n",
      "difficult to scale up for large-scale purification (3).\n",
      "Liquid-liquid extraction in an aqueous two-phase system\n",
      "(ATPS)1 can offer an efficient technique for protein purifica-\n",
      "tion even in large scale (4-6). Methods mainly based on\n",
      "poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-salt, PEG-dextran, and PEG-\n",
      "starch are used. Recently, also thermoseparating polymers\n",
      "and surfactants, which are especially suitable for protein\n",
      "purification, have been introduced. The partitioning of a\n",
      "protein to one of the phases may depend on its surface charge\n",
      "or hydrophobicity, but the driving forces are not always well\n",
      "understood. Obviously, the selectivity and overall efficiency\n",
      "of the purification depend on how much the particular protein\n",
      "of interest differs in these relevant properties as compared\n",
      "to the rest of the proteins in the mixture. To achieve selective\n",
      "protein purification in ATPS, small hydrophobic tags con-\n",

      "with anticancer activities [10] may also present some constraints, as the fact that some are\n",
      "considered to be anti-nutrients and/or can exert cytotoxicity at high levels. Findings in our\n",
      "group provided a new alternative on this matter when we discovered a new MMPI oligomeric\n",

      "in very low amounts in the seeds [15], hence a diet on lupin seeds per se would not suffice\n",
      "to exert the necessary effects. In fact, this is the one of the most challenging problems with\n",
      "foodborne anticancer compounds [16]. They often never reach clinical or even pre-clinical\n",
      "trials because their production is hampered by the cost of their synthetic production, or\n",
      "there are no cost-effective methods for obtaining gram quantities of their highly purified\n",

      "cleaving elements. In these modified inteins, cleavage takes\n",
      "place at one or both splice junctions and is typically controlled\n",
      "by pH or thiol reagents (Mathys et al. 1999; Chong et al.\n",

      "and maltose-binding protein (MBP) (Xu et al. 1999). In most\n",

      "various conﬁgurations7–12. This technique appears to retain the\n",
      "generality of afﬁnity tag separations13, and is also highly scaleable\n",
      "and eliminates the need for expensive afﬁnity resins and apparatus.\n",
      "An important limitation that remained, however, was that the ELP\n",

      "speciﬁcally at its C-terminus in response to changes in pH and\n",
      "temperature16. Alternatively, the method reported by Ge et al.14\n",

      "inteins higher yielding in some expression systems. On the other\n",

      "Grateloupia turuturu [1], Heterosiphonia japonica [2], and Porphyra yezoensis. Among them, Porphyra\n",
      "yezoensis is one of the major seaweeds abundantly cultivated in China [3]. It is easy to obtain, and the\n",
      "price is low. Besides, P. yezoensis has a higher protein content than other red algae (47% of dry\n",
      "weight) [4,5]. Because of this, it has attracted increasing attention as a healthy food and as a medicine\n",
      "to slow down the ageing process [3,6]. R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) is one of the major phycobiliproteins in\n",
      "P. yezoensis. Its purity is generally calculated by the absorbance ratio (A565/A280), and the market price is\n",
      "around 200 USD/mg (Sigma-Aldrich, product number: 52412-1MG-F) [7,8]. Therefore, R-PE is regarded\n",
      "as a bioactive molecule with high value. It has been reported that R-PE has numerous biological\n",
      "activities, including antioxidant [9], anti-inﬂammatory [10], anti-aging [11], and immunomodulatory\n",
      "activity [12,13]. R-PE has excellent optical properties as a natural ﬂuorescent protein [1,14]. Based on\n",

      "Although virus-like particles (VLPs) have been used as vaccines and \n",
      "drug delivery carriers [1,2], their preparations have been problematic \n",
      "and challenging. One of the most important challenge is the conforma-\n",
      "tional heterogeneity from expression in various host cells [3,4] and \n",

      "low yield and low biological activity. Due to the lack of specific genetic \n",
      "materials for VLPs, in addition to VLPs, the recombinant expression \n",
      "products also include assembly subunits as well as incomplete particles \n",
      "[3,6,7]. Such cases would result in low protein yield of direct isolation. \n",
      "On the other side, the architectural structure of VLPs is maintained \n",

      "Another challenge is the host nucleic acids encapsulated in VLPs, \n",

      "VLPs we used were hepatitis B core (HBc) protein particles, which is a \n",
