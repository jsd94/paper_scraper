In a previous work, a thioredoxin from the thermophilic organism Aliciclobacillus acidocaldarius (Alitrx)\\nwas puriﬁed, characterized, and its gene expressed in Escherichia coli. In order to produce larger quantities of Alitrx, the protein has\\nbeen expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and in the gram positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis. The growth conditions\\nof strains showing high-level expression of Alitrx were optimized for both systems in shake-ﬂask cultures. Active proteins were\\nsecreted in the culture media at a level of approximately 0.9 and 0.5 g/L, respectively, for P. pastoris and B. subtilis. The proteins\\nwere puriﬁed almost to homogeneity by a thermal precipitation procedure, with a 90-fold and 50-fold higher total yield with respect\\nto that obtained with the same protein expressed in E. coli. The results indicate that either of these two systems could be utilized as a\\nhost for large-scale production of recombinant Alitrx.\\n� 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.\\nThioredoxins (Trxs) are small proteins that have a\\nredox-active disulﬁde/dithiol group within the conserved\\nactive site sequence Cys–Gly–Pro–Cys. Reduced Trx\\ncatalyzes the reduction of disulﬁde bonds in multiple\\nsubstrate proteins, and oxidized Trx is reversibly re-\\nduced by the action of Trx reductase and NADPH [1,2].\\nTrx is widely present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes,\\nand appears to be ubiquitous in almost all living cells\\n[1,3]. It is a multifunctional protein that has regulatory\\nroles in cellular signalling and gene transcription [3] in\\naddition to cytoprotective activities due to its quenching\\nof reactive oxygen species [4,5]. Thioredoxin systems\\nserve as hydrogen donors, for example, for ribonucleo-\\ntide reductase, phosphoadenosyl phosphosulfate reduc-\\ntase, and methionine sulfoxide reductase [1]. Moreover,\\nthioredoxin has been involved in thiol-disulﬁde ex-\\nchange and disulﬁde bond formation [6]. The multiple\\nroles played by Trx as well as its ability to reduce di-\\nsulﬁde bridges that do not respond to other cellular re-\\nductants have potential applications for the solution of\\ncertain problems, especially in nutrition and medicine\\n[7–9].\\nRecently, the cloning and characterization of thiore-\\ndoxin from the thermophilic organism Aliciclobacillus\\nacidocaldarius (Alitrx) and the expression of the bio-\\nlogically active protein in Escherichia coli was reported\\n[10]. This protein shows a higher resistance to temper-\\nature relative to its mesophilic counterparts [11,12], and\\nthis feature oﬀers several interesting advantages in terms\\nof biotechnological applications. Although protein ob-\\ntained in E. coli was suﬃcient to perform a variety of\\nexperiments, the eﬃciency of Alitrx production (about\\n5.4% of total cytosolic amount) and the complex puri-\\nﬁcation procedures proved unsatisfactory. In an attempt\\nto establish a more eﬃcient system for the production of\\nthis protein, Pichia pastoris and Bacillus subtilis were\\ninvestigated as potential expression systems. Both of\\nthese expression systems can be scaled-up from shake-\\nﬂask to large fermenter cultures and both are able to\\nProtein Expression and Puriﬁcation 30 (2003) 179–184\\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/yprep\\n* Corresponding author.

Secre-\\ntion serves as a major puriﬁcation step by separating the\\nforeign protein product from the bulk of native proteins\\nand other molecules contained in the cell. In addition,\\nthe thermostability of the thermophilic proteins was\\nexploited for its puriﬁcation by a thermal precipitation\\nprocedure.\\nThis paper reports the cloning and expression of\\nAlitrx from A. acidocaldarius in P. pastoris and B. sub-\\ntilis and its puriﬁcation. The level of puriﬁed re-\\ncombinant protein reached approximately 900 mg/L of\\nculture medium in P. pastoris, and approximately\\n500 mg/L of culture medium in B. subtilis.\\nMaterials and methods\\nAnalytical methods for DNA and protein\\nDNA manipulations were done according to Sam-\\nbrook et al. [17]. DNA sequencing was carried out by\\nthe Sanger method, using the Sequenase version 2.0 se-\\nquencing kit (Amersham) on both strands. PCRs were\\ndone by using Fisher Red Taq.\\nProtein concentration was determined by the Pierce\\nmethod [18], using BSA as standard. SDS–PAGE was\\nperformed essentially, as described by Laemmli [19].\\nStrains and vectors\\nEscherichia coli DH5a strain was used for yeast and\\nbacillus vectors propagation, while the P. pastoris\\nGS115 strain (Invitrogen) and the B. subtilis DB428\\nstrain (provided by Arnold) were used as the ﬁnal hosts.\\nThe pPIC9 and pHILS1 (Invitrogen) vectors were\\nused for the extracellular expression in P. pastoris, while\\nthe shuttle pBE3 vector (provided by Arnold) was used\\nfor the extracellular expression in B. subtilis.\\nConstruction of expression plasmids and transformation\\nof P. pastoris\\nTwo Alitrx expression constructs were created for the\\nexpression in P. pastoris. In both, the complete Alitrx\\ncoding region was ampliﬁed by PCR using the re-\\ncombinant E. coli pTR99A vector as a template. The\\nprimers, Alit Rev AGAGAACTAGTGAATTCATG\\nGCTATGATGACGTTG and Alit Forw AGAGAA\\nCTAGTGAATTCTTACTGTAATACATCTGC\\nwere\\ndesigned to contain the EcoRI restriction site at each\\nend. The PCR product was puriﬁed by agarose gel ex-\\ntraction, cut with EcoRI, and inserted into EcoRI cut\\npPIC9 and pHILS1 plasmids, in frame with the Sac-\\ncharomyces cerevisiae a-factor signal peptide and the\\nPichia pastoris PHO1 leader sequence, respectively.\\nThese two recombinant vectors were subjected to DNA\\nsequencing to conﬁrm the nucleotide sequence and the\\ncorrect frame with the peptide leader sequences.\\nManipulation of P. pastoris\\nProcedures suggested by the providers of the P. pas-\\ntoris expression system were used (Invitrogen). The ex-\\npression plasmids were linearized with BglII and the\\nDNAs were introduced into the P. pastoris strain GS115\\nby electroporation. The transformants were selected for\\nability to grow in the absence of histidine (hisþ) and\\nthen were further screened for disruption of the AOX\\ngene by selecting for slow growth in the presence of\\nmethanol (muts). A total of 100 hisþmuts/mutþ trans-\\nformants were tested for expression of Alitrx in 10 mL\\ncultures, by checking the cell-free induction medium on\\n15% acrylammide Tris–glycine gels followed by Coo-\\nmassie blue staining. The Alitrx transformed colonies\\nthat produced the highest levels of Alitrx were used for\\nfurther analysis.\\nHaving identiﬁed the best protein-producing Alitrx\\ntransformants, named ppAlitrxR and ppAlitrxH8, and\\ndetermined the optimal growth pH after induction and\\nthe time-course, intermediate-scale culture was carried\\nout using an incubator Certomat (Braun). The selected\\nclones were grown in YPD medium [1.34% yeast nitro-\\ngen base without amino acids (Bio 101), 2% dextrose] at\\n30 �C for 12 h. The cultures were then transferred to\\nBMGY medium (0.1 M potassium phosphate buﬀer, pH\\n6.0 (Sigma), 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino\\nacids, 1% glycerol, 400 lg/L D-biotin (Sigma), 1% yeast\\nextract, and 2% Bacto-peptone) and continued growing\\nat 30 �C with vigorous shaking, until the OD600 was\\napproximately 1. Then, the cells were pelleted and,\\nthereafter, resuspended on one-half volume of induction\\nmedium in BMMY (same as BMGY but 1% methanol\\nin place of glycerol, plus 1% casamino acids). The in-\\nduction was carried out at 29 �C, 240 rpm, in 3 L ﬂasks\\nfor 5 days, after which time the expression level of the\\nprotein does not increase further.\\nConstruction of expression plasmids and transformation\\nof B. subtilis\\nThe Alitrx coding region contained in the re-\\ncombinant E. coli vector pTR99A was ampliﬁed by\\nPCR using two primers designed to contain a SmaI re\\nstriction site at the 50 end (TCCCCCGGGATGGC\\nTATGATGACGTTGA) and a BamHI restriction site\\nat the 30 end (CGCGCGGATCCTTACTGTAATAC\\nATCTGC). This fragment was puriﬁed by agarose gel\\nelectrophoresis, cut with SmaI and BamHI restriction\\nenzymes, and subcloned in frame with the B. subtilis\\nsubtilisin E signal peptide in the pBE3 vector [20] in-\\n180\\nD.F. Anna et al. / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 30 (2003) 179–184\\nstead of the subtilisin coding region previously cut oﬀ by\\nusing SmaI and BamHI restriction sites. The re-\\ncombinant vector was checked by sequencing and was\\nused to transform DB428 B. subtilis cells by the two-step\\nprotocol [21]. The transformants were selected on LB\\nplates containing Kanamicin.\\nManipulation of B. subtilis\\nThe B. subtilis strain was routinely grown with vig-\\norous agitation at 37 �C in synthetic medium [21] or in\\ncomplex medium.\\nFor expression studies the sporulation medium 2�\\nSG [22] was used. After having determined the optimal\\nexpression conditions in small scale, the growth was\\ndone at 37 �C for 24 h with vigorous agitation (260 rpm).\\nTo determine the expression of the protein, the cell-free\\ninduction medium was analyzed by SDS–PAGE elec-\\ntrophoresis followed by Coomassie blue staining.\\nActivity assay and puriﬁcation of recombinant Alitrx\\nThe turbidimetric assay of the reduced insulin pre-\\ncipitation was used to monitor the protein activity ac-\\ncording to Holmgren [10,23]. In consequence of the\\nreduction of the inter-chain disulﬁde bridges between\\nchains A and B of insulin catalyzed by the Alitrx, the\\nturbidity of the solution increases due to the precipita-\\ntion of the free B chains.\\nTo the standard assay mixture containing 0.1 M so-\\ndium phosphate buﬀer (pH 7.0)/0.13 mM bovine insulin\\nwas added to 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and the Alitrx\\nin a ﬁnal volume of 1 mL at 30 �C. One unit is deﬁned as\\nthe amount of protein that produces an increase of 0.1\\nOD in 1 min at 650 nm.\\nThe recombinant protein present in the cell-free\\ngrowth medium was puriﬁed nearby to homogeneity by\\ntwo successive heat treatments (at 80 �C, respectively)\\nfor 20 min. Samples were extensively dialyzed against\\n20 mM Tris/HCl buﬀer (pH 8.0)/2 mM EDTA and\\nloaded onto a Resource Q Column (Amersham) equil-\\nibrated in the same buﬀer. The column was eluted with\\na linear gradient of 0–0.2 M NaCl at a ﬂow rate of\\n60 mL/h, with the active pools obtained with low ionic\\nstrength.\\nResults and discussion\\nExpression in P. pastoris\\nTwo P. pastoris expression plasmids were constructed\\nand used to transform the yeast. To explore which signal\\npeptide normally used for P. pastoris secretion was best\\nfor our protein, two constructs were made by placing the\\nAlitrx coding sequence downstream of the P. pastoris\\nalcohol oxidase promoter. The ﬁrst construct used the\\nP. pastoris PHO1 signal sequence, while the second used\\nthe S. cerevisiae a-factor leader sequence. The Alitrx\\ngene was ampliﬁed by PCR and ligated into EcoRI cut\\nvectors containing signal peptides, as described under\\nMaterials and methods, to yield plasmids ppHLSAlit\\nand ppPICAlit. For both the constructs, approximately\\n100 Hisþ clones were tested for expression by direct\\nchecking of culture samples with Coomassie blue\\nstaining after electrophoretic separation on 15% SDS–\\nPAGE gels. Ten clones secreting a protein of the ex-\\npected molecular weight (approximately 10–12 kDa)\\n(data not shown) were chosen for further analysis, as\\nthey appeared to secrete adequate levels of protein. The\\ncell-free\\ninduction\\nmedia,\\ntogether\\nwith\\nan\\nequal\\namount of protein from cells transformed with a non-\\nrecombinant expression vector (negative control), were\\nassayed for insulin reductase activity. Comparable ac-\\ntivities were found in each supernatant. Small-scale ex-\\npression studies were performed in BMMY medium to\\nfurther optimize the expression conditions with a strain\\ntransformed with each plasmid, with the aim of ob-\\ntaining the highest expression levels (active protein per\\nliter of broth) possible.\\nGS115/ppAlitR\\n(containing\\nthe\\nppPICAlit\\nre-\\ncombinant plasmid) and GS115/ppAlitH8 (containing\\nthe ppHLSAlit recombinant plasmid) clones were in-\\nduced in large shake-ﬂask cultures, as described in\\nMaterials and methods, at a dilution of one-half volume\\nof induction medium in BMMY for a period of 5 days.\\nDuring this period, increasing amounts of Alitrx accu-\\nmulated. After this time, the level of secreted protein\\nwas approximately 0.9 g/L for GS115ppAlitH8 and\\n0.8 g/L for GS115/ppAlitR, respectively.\\nThe induction was sustained by adding methanol to a\\nconcentration of 1% every 24 h. The optimum pH was\\ndetermined to be 6.0. In order to inhibit further the\\nproteases of P. pastoris, casamino acids were also added.\\nUnder these conditions, other protein products were\\nalso detected in the supernatant, even though Alitrx was\\nthe predominant protein in the induction media (Fig. 1).\\nThe supernatant was processed by two successive ther-\\nmal precipitations at 80 �C for 20 min. The protein pu-\\nriﬁed after this precipitation was approximately 75%\\npure (Fig. 1) and had a high catalytic activity, as con-\\nﬁrmed by the turbidimetric assay. However, a second\\nprominent and sharp band was also present and was\\nfurther investigated. To remove this second protein, the\\nsample was subject to anionic-exchange chromatogra-\\nphy, as summarized in Table 1. Our data indicated that,\\nafter this step, the two proteins were separated and that\\nonly the fraction containing the lower band showed in-\\nsulin reductase activity, while the upper band was an\\nunknown P. pastoris protein, as suggested by sequence\\ndetermination and the literature data [24].\\nD.F. Anna et al. / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 30 (2003) 179–184\\n181\\nExpression in B. subtilis\\nFor expression in B. subtilis, we placed the Alitrx\\ncoding region under control of the B. subtilis AprE\\n(subtilisin E) gene promoter, which is highly expressed\\nduring sporulation, and in frame with the peptide se-\\ncretion signal of this gene [20]. We selected positive\\nclones by means of Kanamicin resistance and after re-\\nstriction and PCR analysis to conﬁrm the presence of\\nthe recombinant plasmid, we carried out shake-ﬂask\\nculture expression with three of these clones to deter-\\nmine the best parameters for expression. Cell-free\\nsporulation medium samples were examined by 15%\\nSDS–PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining for\\nthe presence of Alitrx. As already described for P. pas-\\ntoris, we also evaluated catalytic activity of Alitrx. As\\nthere were no diﬀerences between these clones, we per-\\nformed all further expression optimization experiments\\non one of these, namely bsAlitrx1. Expression was in-\\nduced by growing the strain with vigorous agitation\\ninoculated to an initial OD600 of 0.15 for 24 h. Under\\nthese conditions, only a few contaminating products\\nwere detected, and Alitrx was the predominant protein\\nin the sporulation medium (Fig. 2). We monitored\\nprotein production at 1-h intervals for 26 h of growth by\\nmeasuring insulin-reduction and by SDS–PAGE. The\\noptimal time of induction was determined to be 24 h;\\nafter this period, the quantity of our protein decreased,\\nsuggesting that, although the strain used was a ‘‘prote-\\nase�-deﬁcient’’ strain, proteases were still produced. The\\nsupernatant from 100 mL of culture medium was col-\\nlected and used for puriﬁcation, as described for P.\\npastoris. The results of the puriﬁcation procedure are\\nsummarized in Table 2.\\nUnlike P. pastoris, the supernatant was subjected to\\nonly one round of thermal precipitation at 80 �C for\\ntwenty min, which was suﬃcient to eliminate most\\ncontaminating proteins present in the medium (Fig. 2;\\nTable 2). Also in this case, the supernatant was sub-\\njected to an anion-exchange chromatography step, as\\ndescribed in Materials and methods and as shown\\nin Fig. 2, in order to further remove contaminating\\nproteins.\\nComparison of the recombinant thioredoxins\\nThe speciﬁc activity of each protein was characterized\\nby turbidimetric assay and no diﬀerences were observed\\nbetween Alitrx expressed in P. pastoris, B. subtilis, and\\nE. coli.

The level of expression obtained\\nusing these secreted systems was approximately 70-fold\\nhigher than that observed with the best E. coli expres-\\nsion strain. Moreover, the maximum level of expression\\nachieved with the constructs (approximately 0.9 and\\n0.5 g/L of the P. pastoris and B. subtilis cell-free growth\\nmedium, respectively, using shake-ﬂask culture condi-\\ntions) is expected to increase signiﬁcantly in high-density\\nfermenter cultures.\\nThe excellent yield and simple puriﬁcation make the\\nP. pastoris and B. subtilis expression systems convenient\\nfor Alitrx production and commercial exploitation.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis research was supported by a collaborative grant\\nfrom the Campania Region to Prof. Mos�e Rossi.

      " \n",
      "Background: Phenylalanine dehydrogenase (PheDH; EC 1.4.1.20) is a NAD+-dependent enzyme that \n",
      "performs the reversible oxidative deamination of L-phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate. It plays an important \n",
      "role in detection and screening of phenylketonuria (PKU) diseases and production of chiral intermediates as \n",
      "well. The main goal of this study was to find a simple and rapid alternative method for purifying PheDH. \n",
      "Methods: The purification of recombinant Bacillus sphaericus PheDH was investigated in polyethylene \n",
      "glycol (PEG) and ammonium sulfate aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). The influences of system \n",
      "parameters including PEG molecular weight and concentration, pH and (NH4)2SO4 concentration on enzyme \n",
      "partitioning were also studied. The purity of enzyme was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide \n",

      "recombinant PheDH from E. coli BL21 (DE3). The optimized conditions for partitioning and purification of \n",
      "PheDH were 9% (w/w) PEG-6,000 and 16% (w/w) (NH4)2SO4 at pH 8.0. The partition coefficient, recovery, \n",
